There were some local changes, highlighted in *.diff files.

The most important set if changes is in mus1.f, which handles some
previously unhandled divergences during the ODE integration and
turns them into the error codes (before the integrator fails with FPE).

These error conditions deserve to be studied more closely, but unfortunately
I can't find time for this right now.
